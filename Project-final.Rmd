# Introduction

Tropical shallow water coral reef ecosystems are highly diverse and
sensitive ecosystems dependent on complex interactions between organisms
and their environment. However, the exponential increase in
anthropogenic carbon dioxide ($CO_2$) emissions has led to adverse
effects such as ocean acidification (OA) and warming (OW) (Cheng et al.,
2022; Doney et al., 2009).

Excess $CO_2$ dissolving in seawater leads to production of carbonic
acid ($H_2CO_3$) and increased hydrogen ions ($H^+$), causing ocean
acidification. This disrupts the carbonate system and reduces the
availability of carbonate ions ($CO_3^{2-}$), affecting the saturation
states of calcium carbonate compounds like aragonite (Doney et al.,
2009). Aragonite saturation is particularly important for coral reefs as
it affects their ability to build and maintain calcium carbonate
skeletons, which form the majority of reef structures. OA and OW have
been observed to reduce saturation, leading to weakened structures,
dissolution of shells, and decreased calcification rates, posing a
threat to coral reef ecosystems (Cornwall et al., 2021).

Higher temperatures increase the solubility of calcium carbonate,
allowing seawater to hold more dissolved forms, including aragonite.
However, temperature indirectly affects ($CO_3^{2-}$) concentration.
Rising temperatures lead to increased acidity in the system, causing a
decrease in $CO_3^{2-}$ concentration. Conversely, lower temperatures
shift the system towards more basic conditions, increasing $CO_3^{2-}$
concentration (Xue et al., 2020).

Our study aims to develop a machine-learning model using data from the
GRB to understand how aragonite saturation will change with predicted
warming scenarios. By accurately predicting aragonite levels, we can
gain insights into reef growth or degradation, aiding conservation
planning. This study predicts aragonite saturation and assesses the
reef's ability to grow, crucial due to climate change's impact on coral
reef growth. Rising CO2 levels and subsequent temperature changes affect
aragonite saturation. Insufficient aragonite concentration (\<1) impedes
carbonate structure formation, while higher saturation (\>3) supports
reef development (NOAA, 2015 & Jiang et al., 2015). Ultimately, our
interdisciplinary project serves the objective of supporting marine park
officials in making informed, data-driven decisions for reef
conservation and efficient resource allocation.

# Method

To accomplish this, we employ three prominent machine learning
algorithms: k-nearest neighbours (KNN), support vector machines (SVM),
and linear-regression. To substantiate our choices from a data science
standpoint, we conduct thorough evaluations of scalability, stability,
and evaluation metrics such as Root-Mean-Squared-Error (RMSE) and Mean
Absolute Error (MAE).

Evaluating the stability and scalability of our models is of utmost
importance in our assessment of their performance and suitability for
predicting aragonite levels in coral reefs. The combination of
assessments allows us to select models that not only provide reliable
estimations of aragonite levels but also demonstrate resilience and
adaptability to different data scenarios.

Additionally, by comparing the RMSE and MAE across different models, we
can identify which model yields the smallest prediction errors and
demonstrates superior performance. These metrics enable us to
quantitatively assess the models' accuracy and determine their
suitability for predicting aragonite levels in coral reefs.

## Data Load

Data used for this study was collected from a project called eReefs,
initiated by the Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS). The AIMS
eReefs platform provides current models of hydrodynamic and
biogeochemical data for the GBR. From this source, relevant data for the
GBR was obtained. The two datasets of interest to use were the
hydrodynamics and biogeochemical datasets, and specific variables were
chosen based on the expertise of Marine students and $R^2$ values.
Whilst pH is an important variable to predict aragonite it was excluded
due to problems of overfitting. Detailed variables are listed in the
Appendix.

All data files were stored as NetCDF files, requiring the ncd4 package
in R for the collection process. We obtained five years of data from
2015 - 2019 ensuring the size of our data-set. The longitude and
latitude variables were extracted as the reference points for all other
variables, also used for later analysis. Hydrodynamic and biogeochemical
data-sets were merged based on coordinates. Consistency across the
data-sets allowed for a complete match. Rows with missing values were
removed as enough data was obtained. Downsizing was performed based on
longitude, as latitude values were within close proximity of each other.
Using a 1km grid, values were aggregated by taking the mean of entries
within each grid cell.

## Regression Modelling

Our choice of selecting KNN, SVM and linear-regression models is
supported by relevant published research. Burns et al. (2022) and
Nathaphon et al. (2022) demonstrate the effectiveness of SVM and KNN in
predicting environmental factors related to coral reefs. Meanwhile,
research conducted by Lowe et al.(2011) and Ellis et al. (2019)
highlights the relevance of linear-regression in understanding reef
dynamics. By leveraging these established algorithms, our
interdisciplinary approach enhances the accuracy and robustness of our
predictions. 

### Linear Regression

First, we manually filter out variables that we don't need based on
marine science and apply backward selection to get the backward
selection model.

```{r}
merge <- subset(merge_all, select = -c(co2, pH, wind_speed_u, wind_speed_v, carbonate, mean_current_wspeed, date))

m1 = lm(aragonite ~ ., data = merge)
m2 = step.back.aic = step(m1, direction = "backward", trace = FALSE)
```

<center>**Table 1: Summary of Backward Selection Model**</center>

The final backward selection model include finesed, salinity, macroalgae
production, temperature, and mean wind speed as independent variables.

```{r message=FALSE, warning = FALSE}
 summ(m2)

equatiomatic::extract_eq(m2, use_coefs=TRUE, wrap = TRUE)

```

Our backward selection model shows excellent performance with an
R-square value of 95.4%. However, to enhance user convenience in the
shiny app, we have included latitude and longitude in our model. This
addition allows users to predict aragonite levels for specific
coordinates. The shiny app will utilize the provided data, including
coordinates, to generate predictions, and subsequently display the
corresponding point on the GBR map

The R-square of the final model is 95.3%.

```{r}
m3 = lm(formula = aragonite ~ finesed + salinity + `macroalgae production` + 
    temp + mean_wspeed + latitude + longitude, data = merge)
```

<center>**Table 2: Summary of Backward Model with Coordinates**</center>

This is selected as our final model.

```{r message=FALSE, warning = FALSE}
summ(m3)
equatiomatic::extract_eq(m3, use_coefs=TRUE, wrap = TRUE)
```

The R-square of the final model is 95.3%. <br>

### Interaction

We also consider if the interaction is significant to our model. Wind
speed and temperature are closely related and interact. Firstly,
temperature differences can generate pressure gradients, which in turn
drive wind flow. The pressure gradient between these regions causes air
to move, resulting in wind. Secondly, temperature influences the amount
of moisture air can hold. Warm air can hold more water vapour than cold
air. Wind speed can also affect temperature by transporting air masses
from different regions, which may have varying temperature
characteristics. Therefore, wind speed and temperature are
interconnected and play a crucial role in shaping weather patterns and
climate conditions.

```{r}
m3 = lm(formula = aragonite ~ finesed + salinity + `macroalgae production` + 
    temp + mean_wspeed + latitude + longitude + temp:mean_wspeed, data = merge)
```

<center>**Table 3: Summary of Final Model (with interaction)**</center>

```{r message=FALSE, warning = FALSE}
summ(m3)
equatiomatic::extract_eq(m3, use_coefs=TRUE, wrap = TRUE)
```

Table-3 reveals that temperature loses its significance when we
incorporate the interaction between temperature and wind speed. This
implies that the previous model's significant relationship with
temperature was actually due to the interaction between temperature and
wind speed, rather than temperature alone. Additionally, Table-3
indicates that the inclusion of this interaction leads to an increase of
approximately 0.1% in the R-square value.

As a result, we add the temp:windspeed and keep the temperature in the
final model.

### Support Vector Machine

SVM model using 10-CV analysis

```{r}
set.seed(3888)

svm_model = svm(aragonite ~ finesed + salinity + `macroalgae production` + 
    temp + mean_wspeed  + latitude + longitude + temp:mean_wspeed, data = merge)

```

### K-Nearest Neighbor

KNN model using 10-CV analysis

```{r}
# Define the training control
ctrl <- trainControl(method = "cv", number = 10)

# Define k-NN model
knn_model <- train(aragonite ~ finesed + salinity + `macroalgae production` + 
    temp + mean_wspeed + latitude + longitude + temp:mean_wspeed, data = merge, method = "knn",
trControl = ctrl, tuneGrid = data.frame(k = seq(1, 10, by = 1)))

# Make predictions using the cross-validated model
#predictions <- predict(knn_model, newdata = merge)

```

## Assumption Checking

For our model, backward selection and simple, assumptions for 4 aspects
have been assessed - linearity, Independence, homoscedasticity and
normality.

```{r warning=FALSE, fig.height=3, fig.topcaption=TRUE, fig.align='center', fig.cap="Figure 1: Fitted values vs residuals plot \\& QQ-plot for backward model", fig.pos = "H", echo=FALSE}
autoplot(m3, which = 1:2) + theme_bw()
```

-   **Residual Plot**: According to figure 1, there is no obvious smiley
    or frowny face in residual vs fitted values plots when the fitted
    value is greater than 3.475. However, there is a smiley face when
    the fitted value is less than 3,475, thus assuming non-linearity.
    But since the smiley face is not obvious, we can accept that
    linearity is slightly violated.

-   **Independence** is barely met due to the experimental design such
    that for each location, an observation is made annually for five
    years. But since the time interval is long enough, we can accept
    that independence doesn't meet perfectly.

-   **Homoscedasticity** according to figure 1, the spread doesn't look
    reasonably constant over the range of fitted values, and there is a
    diamond pattern in both residual vs fitted plots. So, we can say
    that homoscedasticity doesn't exist. However, since the spread of
    residual is narrower when the fitted value is below 30 and wider
    above 60, we can accept that the homoscedasticity doesn't perfectly
    meet in this case.

-   **Normality** is assumed as shown by linear QQ-plots of each model;
    most of the points are close to the line.

-   **Transformation**: We try to transform the model by using log() on
    predictors, but still not satisfied with linearity and
    homoscedasticity. To get a model that is easy to interpret, We leave
    the model as it is.

## Model Evaluation

To evaluate the performance and accuracy of our predictive models, we
employ two widely used evaluation metrics: Root Mean Squared Error
(RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). These metrics provide valuable
insights into the models' predictive capabilities and their ability to
estimate aragonite levels in coral reefs.

```{r}
set.seed(3888)

cv_knn = train(aragonite ~ finesed + salinity + `macroalgae production` + temp + mean_wspeed + latitude + longitude + temp:mean_wspeed, data = merge,
 method = "knn",
 trControl = trainControl(
 method = "cv", number = 10,
 verboseIter = FALSE
 )
)

cv_svm = train(aragonite ~ finesed + salinity + `macroalgae production` + temp + mean_wspeed + latitude+longitude + temp:mean_wspeed, data = merge,
 method = "svmLinear",
 trControl = trainControl(
 method = "cv", number = 10,
 verboseIter = FALSE
 )
)

cv_lm = train(aragonite ~ finesed + salinity + `macroalgae production` + temp + mean_wspeed + latitude+longitude + temp:mean_wspeed, data = merge,
 method = "lm",
 trControl = trainControl(
 method = "cv", number = 10,
 verboseIter = FALSE
 )
)

results <- resamples(list(KNN = cv_knn,  SVM = cv_svm, Linear_Model = cv_lm))

c(mean(cv_lm$resample$RMSE), mean(cv_knn$resample$RMSE), mean(cv_svm$resample$RMSE))
c(mean(cv_lm$resample$MAE), mean(cv_knn$resample$MAE),mean(cv_svm$resample$MAE))
```

### RMSE & MAE

```{r warning=FALSE, fig.height=2, fig.topcaption=TRUE, fig.align='center', fig.cap="Figure 2: RMSE & MAE between linear regression, SVM and KNN"}

# Plot both RMSE and MAE on the same graph
plot_rmse <- ggplot(results, metric = "RMSE") +
  labs(y = "RMSE")

plot_mae <- ggplot(results, metric = "MAE") +
  labs(y = "MAE")

gridExtra::grid.arrange(plot_rmse, plot_mae, ncol = 2)

```

Our mean root-mean-squared-error for the linear model, 0.008745511, is
slightly smaller than the svm model, 0.008859468, as shown in figure 2.
Compared to lm and svm, mean RMSE of KNN model is only 0.003598737, much
lower than both of them. So we could say the KNN model is doing a better
prediction.

Mean MAE for the lm model is 0.006705319 and 0.006714421 for the SVM
model, as shown in figure 2. For KNN, the mean MAE is 0.001792831. This
also suggests that the KNN model makes the best prediction.

```{r}
sd(merge$aragonite)
```

By comparing the RMSE(0.003598737) and MAE(0.001792831) of KNN model
with the standard deviation(0.04138637) of the original aragonite data,
we can say that all three models are more reliable than randomly select
a result from the aragonite data.

## Evaluation Conclusion

Through the evaluation of RMSE and MAE, we gain valuable insights into
the predictive capabilities of our models and can make informed
decisions regarding model selection. By selecting the model with the
lowest RMSE and MAE, we aim to ensure the highest level of accuracy in
predicting aragonite levels, enhancing our ability to support
decision-making processes in marine park conservation efforts and
effectively protect coral reef ecosystems.

In our case, the KNN model has the lowest RMSE and MAE, and both of them
are less than the standard deviation of the original.\*\*As a result, we
select the KNN model as the final model.\*\*

# Results

As part of our data science approach, we thoroughly assess the
scalability and stability of the chosen models. Scalability refers to
the model's ability to handle increasing data sizes efficiently,
ensuring that our predictions remain reliable even as the dataset grows.
Stability refers to the consistency of the models' performance across
different subsets of the data, guaranteeing that the predictions are
robust and not overly influenced by specific instances or outliers.

## Model Scalability

To evaluate scalability, we increase the dataset size and measure the
execution time of each model. This analysis allows us to identify any
potential limitations or bottlenecks that may arise when applying the
models to larger datasets.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
set.seed(3888)

knn_check <- function(data, size) {
  data <- data[1:size, ]
  start_time <- Sys.time()
  predictions <- predict(knn_model, newdata = data)
  end_time <- Sys.time()
  return(end_time - start_time)
}

svm_check <- function(data, size) {
  data <- data[1:size, ]
  start_time <- Sys.time()
  predictions = predict(svm_model, newdata=data)
  end_time <- Sys.time()
  return(end_time - start_time)
}

linear_check <- function(data, size) {
  data <- data[1:size, ]
  start_time <- Sys.time()
  predictions <- predict(m3 , newdata = data)
  end_time <- Sys.time()
  return(end_time - start_time)
}


```

```{r warning=FALSE, fig.topcaption=TRUE, fig.align='center', fig.cap="Figure 3: Execution Time of k-NN, SVM, and Linear Regression Models"}


sizes <- c(10, 20, 40, 80, 160, 320, 640, 1280, 2000)

knn_times <- sapply(sizes, function(x) knn_check(merge, x))
svm_times <- sapply(sizes, function(x) svm_check(merge, x))
linear_times <- sapply(sizes, function(x) linear_check(merge, x))


results <- data.frame(model = rep(c("k-NN", "SVM", "Linear Regression"), each = length(sizes)),
                      size = rep(sizes, times = 3),
                      time = c(knn_times, svm_times, linear_times))

# Plot the results
ggplot(results, aes(x = size, y = time, color = model)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(x = "Data Size", y = "Execution Time (Seconds)") +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

The analysis of model scalability showed distinct patterns in execution
time as the data size increased. The SVM model had the steepest slope,
indicating a significant increase in execution time with larger
datasets. This is because the SVM algorithm involves solving a quadratic
optimization problem, which becomes more computationally complex as the
dataset grows.

On the other hand, the k-NN model exhibited a moderate increase in
execution time as the data size expanded. The k-NN algorithm searches
for nearest neighbours in the training data for each prediction, which
becomes more computationally intensive with larger datasets. However,
the increase in execution time for k-NN was relatively less significant
compared to SVM.

In contrast, the linear-regression model showed the fastest execution
time. It displayed a stable line with minimal variation across different
data sizes. This is because linear-regression involves solving a system
of linear equations, which has low computational overhead. As a result,
linear-regression performs efficiently and consistently regardless of
the data size.

## Model Stability

We assess model stability using k-fold cross-validation, dividing the
data into subsets for iterative training and testing. This approach
allows for the measurement of consistency and robustness in performance,
ensuring our models are not hypersensitive to variations in the data.

```{r, message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}

                      Percent_holdout = unlist(percent_holdout),
                      r_squared = c(acc_knn, acc_svm, acc_lm))

Testing models on different data subset sizes from 95% to 30% showed KNN
as the most stable and accurate. Linear-regression and SVM exhibited
similar stability with minor fluctuations. It can be concluded that the
performance of the linear model is highly stable, suggesting that the
model is not overfitted to our training data and performs well on unseen
data. The mean r-squared values for all tests were around 95%, with the
best performance being 95.55% which was the result of testing with 90%. 

Interestingly, the performance of the model tested on 70% and 40% of the
original dataset performed the worst. The fluctuations in performance
appear to be random with no observable pattern, indicating these changes
are likely caused by random factors such as suboptimal subset selection
or close proximity of included data points. Overall, the linear model
demonstrated reliable stability and predictive capability.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thus, Linear Regression is selected as the regression model for our
project due to its time and predictive efficiency.

These findings highlight the importance of considering scalability as
well as stability when selecting a model for our project, ensuring that
it can handle the anticipated data sizes effectively and accurate
predictions in the real-time deployment of our Shiny app.

## Shiny App

Our innovative product aids coral reef conservation by evaluating reef
health using an interactive map and risk calculator that predicts
Aragonite levels. The product presents a comprehensive view of the
aragonite levels at specific coordinates over time, with visual
clustering and plotting. The colours of the risk calculator output
correspond to reef health. Red indicates the coral is under stress,
orange indicates possible stress and green indicates a healthy coral
reef. Users can further adjust key prediction variables to understand
their impact on coral health. Flexible data plotting options allow users
to input new points or select existing data points, facilitating
exploratory and focused research.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("shiny.png")
```

Using our shiny app, we predicted aragonite saturation for
representative concentration pathways (RCP) 2.6 and 8.5 at 2050 and
2100. RCP 8.5 represents "business as usual", while RCP 2.6 is an
optimistic outlook with limited temperature increases (IPCC, 2014). Our
model projected an approximately 1% in aragonite saturation for both
scenarios and time points. Temperature and salinity values under the
respective RCP scenarios were used for these predictions, while other
variables remained constant (IPCC, 2014 & Akhiljith et al., 2019). All
scenarios yielded aragonite saturation values above 3, indicating
favourable conditions for coral accretion through carbonate structure
formation.

# Discussion

## Model discussion

The Linear-regression equation quantifies the impact of each variable on
Aragonite saturation levels, indicating the direction and magnitude of
their influence.

As latitude and longitude move towards the equator, temperature tends to
increase, leading to higher aragonite as the solubility of calcium
carbonate increases (Xue et al., 2020). Increased salinity can decrease
aragonite due to higher alkalinity (Kuchinke et al., 2014). Fine
sediments can reduce water quality, enhancing ocean acidification (Smith
et al., 2020). Higher wind speeds can alter atmospheric conditions,
bring acidified water, and increase upwelling of aragonite-poor water
(Harris et al., 2013 & Xue et al. 2018). Lower aragonite levels may
reduce calcification, allowing macro-algae colonization (Smith et al.,
2020).

## Limitations

The analysis of aragonite data raises several concerns:

1.  Potential over-fitting due to the data distribution
2.  Down-sampling by using the first day of the year
3.  Violation of linear-model assumptions (independence,
    homoscedasticity, linearity)
4.  Exclusion of time as a co-variate, and the direct use of latitude
    and longitude instead of spatial regression.
5.  Data limitations that affect accuracy and reliability: Absolute
    accuracy varies significantly based on variable and location.
    Sediment data is based on 2019 experimental data, extrapolated into
    the past using historic weather and river data. Because of land use
    improvement, earlier values for fine sediment may be underestimated.
    Additionally, some argue that aragonite saturation is unreliable,
    with prior studies being unable to differentiate the effects of
    aragonite and ocean acidity since the two are highly interlinked
    (Jury 2008).

## Improvement process

The points below outline areas for improvement in our study:

1.  [Increase the frequency of data sampling]{.underline}: Since only
    one observation is made per site per year, this may limit the
    independence of the data. Increasing the sampling frequency, such as
    quarterly or monthly observations, can provide more data points to
    enhance the stability and accuracy of the model.

2.  [Consider more influencing factors]{.underline}: Other factors that
    may influence the level of Aragonite such as bleaching, bioerosion
    and water flow rate can be considered. By including more
    comprehensive influencing factors, the predictive power of the model
    can be improved.

3.  [Explore spatial regressions:]{.underline} This can provide a more
    in-depth analysis of the impact of reef location on Aragonite
    levels. Despite including longitude and latitude in the linear
    model, spatial regression can allow us to better capture the spatial
    patterns and correlation that exists within our data.

## Future Work

It is recommended that the forecast model be evaluated and improved
regularly to ensure its long-term stability and accuracy of its
performance. This can include methods such as backtracking,
cross-validation, and updating data sets to continuously improve the
predictive power and adaptability of the model

Additionally, to build upon our study would be useful to extend our
model to predict physical coral growth instead of a component such as
aragonite saturation state. This could be in the form of reef mass or
vertical accretion and would give a more comprehensive view of coral
reef accretion and erosion on the GBR.

# Conclusion

In our study, we employed a linear-regression model to predict aragonite
saturation on the Great Barrier Reef. Model evaluation played a crucial
role in validating our approach and selecting the appropriate model. We
assessed the stability and scalability of the models, considering their
ability to handle different data-set sizes and maintain consistent
performance. Additionally, we used mean absolute error (MAE) and root
mean square error (RMSE) metrics to quantify the predictive accuracy of
the models.

Through rigorous evaluation, we found that the linear-regression model
outperformed the k-nearest neighbors (KNN) and support vector machine
(SVM) models in terms of stability, scalability, and predictive
accuracy. The linear-regression model demonstrated better generalization
capabilities, making it a more suitable choice for our specific research
objective. 

Our model was able to predict aragonite saturation on the GBR. However,
for future predictions under two RCP scenarios using salinity and
temperature, we found that the aragonite saturation state increases,
indicating accretion. This may not be the most reliable result as only
two of our predictor variables were used, therefore, more effort should
be placed in modelling future values of our variables. It would also be
useful to model the physical growth of coral reefs to have more
conclusive results regarding accretion/erosion. 

To conclude, by leveraging the strengths of the linear-regression model
and evaluating it against relevant criteria, we gained confidence in its
ability to accurately predict aragonite saturation levels on the Great
Barrier Reef.
